//
//  Given a linked list l, reverse its nodes k at a time and return the modified list.
//  k is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of l.
//  If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left out at the end should remain as-is.
//  You may not alter the values in the nodes - only the nodes themselves can be changed.
//  Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in l, and O(1) additional space complexity.
//
//  Example
//  For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the output should be
//  solution(l, k) = [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
