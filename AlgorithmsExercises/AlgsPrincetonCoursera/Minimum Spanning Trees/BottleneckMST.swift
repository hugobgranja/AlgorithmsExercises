//  Bottleneck minimum spanning tree.
//  Given a connected edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum bottleneck spanning tree.
//  The bottleneck capacity of a spanning tree is the weights of its largest edge.
//  A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is a spanning tree of minimum bottleneck capacity.
//  The minimum bottleneck spanning tree in an undirected graph is a tree whose most expensive edge is as minimum as possible.
